# Analysis of students' sleep

This project presents an analysis of sleep patterns among university students, examining the impact of factors such as sleep duration, stress levels, and technology use. The analysis is based on a dataset of 100 students from three fields of study (arts, sciences, business) over three academic years.


## Objectives

* Identify the correlation between sleep duration and perceived stress.



* Examine the prevalence of sleep problems and the use of sleep-enhancing technologies.



* Check whether the use of sleep-enhancing technologies reduces the incidence of sleep problems.



* Examine which fields of study and years of study students are most stressed about and whether sleep duration has an impact on this.
